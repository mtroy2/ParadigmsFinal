# ParadigmsFinal

This is the final project for Notre Dame's CSE30332 (Programming Paradigms) course.

Developers:
  Mitchell Troy
  Mason Prosser
  
Idea:
  To recreate the classic game, "Pacman," as a two-player, networked, game. The first player will control the pacman character, as usual, and the second player will control one of the ghost players.

Libraries:
  This project will primarily be developed through the PyGame and Twisted libraries.
