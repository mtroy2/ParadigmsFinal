### HOW TO PLAY ###
Battle Tanks is very simple: first run Server.py, then agree with a friend who will be Player 1 and who will be Player 2.
Each player should execute the appropriate file, which will open up the game window. Click 'Play' to establish a connection
to the server, and the game will begin!

The controls are simple:
- ARROW KEYS:
	Up / Down: Move the tank forward or backward (the front of the tank is marked)
	Left / Right: Rotate the tank left or right
- MOUSE:
	Left click: Fire your cannon

Each player starts with 6 shots, but each player also gets more ammo once every few seconds. The first player to reduce the
other's tank to 0 hit points by shooting it wins!

Much of this information is also available in the INFO screen from the game's main menu.


### KNOWN ISSUES ###
While it is possible to play more than one game in a row by continuing to return to the title menu and clicking 'PLAY', this
has caused a loss of synchronization between players, and a player may not be sent to the correct end-game screen at the end
of a game.
